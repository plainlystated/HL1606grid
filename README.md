# HL1606grid - Addressable matrix of LEDs

A library to control a matrix built out of HL1606-based LED strips. Depends on [adafruit's HL1606strip library](https://github.com/adafruit/HL1606-LED-Strip) (must be installed separately, in libraries/).

This library allows you to set individual LED colors in the grid.

This library doesn't have any PWM support, it's just for primary colors.
